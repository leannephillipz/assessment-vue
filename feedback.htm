          <p>The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.</p>
          <p>Action Plan:</p>
          <p> Improve your annotations so that they are more reflective - describe the task, what have you found out, how will it be useful?. Produce a broader range of Research - collect research from a variety of 1st and 2nd hand sources</p>

          <h4>Task 2 – Careers</h4>
          <p>Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right.</p>
